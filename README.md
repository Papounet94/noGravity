First Person Game

This game is inspired by the movie Gravity. 
The player is lost in space, in his extravehicular suit. This one allows him to navigate in the 3 directions and 
to rotate along the y-axis (vertical axis), with the help of gas jets.
The goal is to reach a safe area inside the ISS.
The air and gas supply is limited. The player must not bump into obstacles at a speed greater than 4 m/s, 
at the risk of damaging his suit and cause his own death.
